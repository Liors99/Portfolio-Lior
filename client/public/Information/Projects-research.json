        "description": "BreachMob is a virtual reality (VR) tool that applies open design principles from information security to physical buildings and structures. BreachMob uses a detailed 3D digital model of a property owner's building. The model is then published as a virtual environment (VE), complete with all applicable security measures and released to the public to test the building's security and find any potential vulnerabilities by completing specified objectives.",

        "description": "The Virtual Rehearsal Studio (VRS) is a virtual reality (VR) tool whose objective is to provide performers with the experience of being in a large-scale rehearsal or performance venue while occupying limited physical space. The VRS relies on twentieth-century acting studio techniques to establish thresholding protocols that facilitate state change and promote user immersion. The VRS is capable of displaying text in VR that the actor can toggle off and on, floor markings that can help guide the actor, a 3D body that is attached to the actor for realism, and an in-game camera that can record the rehearsal session for the actor's convenience.",
